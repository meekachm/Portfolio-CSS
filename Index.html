            <h3>So, who am I?!</h3>
            <p>I am a determined and resilient individual who has embarked on a remarkable journey of self-discovery and growth. My life's journey, marked by the challenges of being a single mother, instilled in me an unwavering determination to overcome adversity.<br>
                <br>Years of living paycheck to paycheck became a defining chapter in my life. While I had grown accustomed to this way of life, I couldn't deny my desire for something more substantial. It was a watershed moment for me when I realized my daughter was rapidly maturing and becoming increasingly independent.<br>
                <br>This realization fueled my decision to return to school and finish my high school education, which marked the start of my transformative journey. I was hungry for knowledge and eager to broaden my horizons after receiving my high school diploma. Initially, I was drawn to nursing by the prospect of making a difference in people's lives.<br>
                <br>My time working in a nursing home, however, revealed an unexpected barrier: an unconscious fear of infectious diseases. This fear of potential symptoms compelled me to reconsider my educational path. I was adamant about continuing to learn, and I was certain that dropping out was not an option.<br>
                <br>Intrigued by the world of technology and driven by my lifelong passion for video games, I made a bold choice. I decided to take a dive into the fascinating world of coding, delving into the intricate workings behind the scenes.<br>
                <br>Embracing challenges and driven by a commitment to personal growth, I proudly stand as a Dominican University of California student, majoring in Applied Computer Science. My journey is a testament to unwavering determination and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Notably, I've had the honor of being accepted into the Shopify Dev Degree Program, a recognition of my dedication to excellence.<br>
                <br>I invite you to join me on this journey of breaking barriers, shaping a future powered by technology, and leaving a positive impact on the world. Let us explore the infinite possibilities of the digital realm together.<br>
